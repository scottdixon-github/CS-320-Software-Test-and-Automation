How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? From my experience with testing procedures over the last two months, I can ensure that the code that I develop can be more functional with testing, the code can be more secure with vulnerability testing and can be easier to use and have a better overall user experience with thorough testing.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? I have incorporated user-supplied needs and stories to round out the development process. It is very important to align yourself with the need of the user since the Agile Framework dictates that Customer-centric businesses generate greater profits, increased employee engagement, and more create satisfied customers. Customer-centric governments and nonprofits create the resiliency, sustainability, and alignment needed to fulfill their mission. All customer-centric enterprises deliver whole-product solutions that are designed with a deep understanding of customer needs. (SAFe, 2021)

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is extremely important to consider the user's needs and the user stories when building the application. The end-user needs to interact with the software in various ways and the design should be the best for the user's needs.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
To design the software I looked at the design constraints developed by the user and the possibilities which we spoke about at the Scrum meetings, during the Sprints, and during the Sprint Review. The final design was accepted by the team and the user so we had the go-ahead to continue the project and refine the software with numerous update releases over the lifetime of the software application.
