# CS-230-Portfolio-
For this course, submit the completed software design document that you created for your client, The Gaming Room, into the GitHub repository for your portfolio. This completed design document demonstrates your ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and communicating it effectively to a client and your development team members.

Once you have submitted your software design document, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
Who was the client?
The client was a company called "The Gaming Room" which wanted a game called "Draw It or Lose It" to be adapted to a wider range of operating systems and to implement security software and cloud storage so that the game has a wider market penetration. Our team designed and adopted design criteria that would allow numerous players to access the game and have unique login and password requirements based on software routines that control the program and teams that want to participate. What type of software did they want you to design? A game software implementation based on OOP and Java programming techniques.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I understood the aspect of scaling the application and the need to implement security for the various operating systems in place. The final project illustrates the methods and processes used. I feel that it turned out very well.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The aspect of first laying out the program flow and using UML assisted in developing a good understanding of the operation of the final finished project. I would like to develop the program further and use updated graphics to create a more interesting interactive game.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the aspect of the various operating systems and think more deeply, maybe using the Agile-Scrum methodology to pinpoint design flaws and to make the application more widely used on a multitude of different gaming platforms.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?
I used the user-supplied needs and stories to round out the development process. It is very impostant since the Agile Framework dictates that Customer-centric businesses generate greater profits, increased employee engagement, and more satisfied customers. Customer-centric governments and nonprofits create the resiliency, sustainability, and alignment needed to fulfill their mission. All customer-centric enterprises deliver whole-product solutions that are designed with a deep understanding of customer needs. (SAFe, 2021)

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is extremely important to consider the user's needs and the user stories when building the application.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
To design the software I looked at the design constraints developed by the user and the possibilities which we spoke about at the Scrum meetings, during the Sprints, and during the Sprint Review. The final design was accepted by the team and the user so we had the go-ahead to continue the project and refine the software with numerous update releases over the lifetime of the software application.
